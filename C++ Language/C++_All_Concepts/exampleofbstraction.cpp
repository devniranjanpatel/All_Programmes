/*
Abstraction Def.- In OOPs, Abstraction is the method of getting information where 
the information needed will be taken in such a simplest way that solely the 
required components are extracted, and also the ones that are considered less 
significant are unnoticed. The concept of abstraction only shows necessary information
 to the users. It reduces the complexity of the 
program by hiding the implementation complexities of programs. 
*/
// Example of Abstraction:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
class Summation 
{
private:
    // private variables
    int a, b, c;
public:
    void sum(int x, int y)
    {
        a = x;
        b = y;
        c = a + b;
        cout<<"Sum of the two number is : "<<c<<endl;
    }
};
int main()
{
    Summation s;
    s.sum(5, 4);
    return 0;
}
